# MonsterChase2D

Simple 2D terminal game where monsters will chase the player which sole objective is to gather the green jewels and avoid getting caught by the monsters. 
The game is built in Lanterna which is a Java library that allows you to write easy semi-graphical user interfaces in a text-only environment. This game was a part of a task and created solely for educational purpose. It's written purely in Java.

The gamemap is built on coordinates and all the logic behind the player/monster movement or obstacle/item placement is built upon the coordinate positions of the grid.
